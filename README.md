# timeago
Simple java library for displaying dates as relative time ago language.

This is a pure Java version of marlonlom/timeago. The code logic is entirely from marlonlom/timeago. Since it does not want to introduce Kotlin's dependent library when it is used, it is rewritten into a pure Java implementation version.
